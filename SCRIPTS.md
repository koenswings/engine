# Provisioning Scripts Reference

This document provides a reference for the main provisioning and utility scripts used in the Engine project.

---

### `install.sh`

-   **Purpose:** A bootstrap script for setting up a new Engine device from scratch. This is the easiest way to perform a fresh installation on a new Raspberry Pi.
-   **Usage:** `curl -sSL <URL_to_install.sh> | sudo bash`
-   **Details:** This script installs the necessary base system dependencies (like Node.js, `zx`, `git`) and then executes the main `build-image.ts` script in local mode to complete the provisioning.

---

### `build-image.ts`

-   **Purpose:** The primary, all-in-one script for provisioning a full Engine device. It can run in two modes:
    1.  **Remote Mode:** Configures a fresh Raspberry Pi over the network.
    2.  **Local Mode:** Configures the local machine it is running on (used by `install.sh`).
-   **Usage (Remote):** `./script/build-image.ts --machine <pi-address> [options]`
-   **Details:** This script handles everything from setting the hostname and installing Docker to deploying the Engine software itself.

---

### `build-app-instance.ts`

-   **Purpose:** Used to create a new **App Disk**. This script takes an existing application definition from a git repository and prepares it as a runnable instance on a specified, mounted disk.
-   **Usage:** `./script/build-app-instance.ts [options] <appName>`
-   **Options:**
    -   `--instance <name>`: A user-friendly name for the instance (defaults to the app name).
    -   `--disk <deviceName>`: The device name of the disk (e.g., `sda1`).
    -   `--git <account>`: The GitHub account to pull the app from.
    -   `--tag <tag>`: The git tag or branch to use (defaults to `latest`).

---

### `build-service.ts`

-   **Purpose:** Used to build a Docker image for a specific service component from its git repository and push it to a container registry like Docker Hub.
-   **Usage:** `./script/build-service.ts [options] <serviceName>`
-   **Options:**
    -   `--registry <url>`: The container registry URL.
    -   `--user <user>`: The user account for the registry.
    -   `--git <account>`: The GitHub account where the service source is located.
    -   `--platform <platform>`: The target platform for the build (e.g., `linux/arm64`).
    -   `--tag <tag>`: The version/tag for the build.

---

### `sync-engine.ts`

-   **Purpose:** A utility script to synchronize code changes from a Development System to a running Runtime System (a Raspberry Pi).
-   **Usage:** `./script/sync-engine.ts --machine <pi-address>`
-   **Details:** This script uses `rsync` to efficiently copy only the changed files, making it ideal for rapid development and testing cycles.

---

### `client.ts`

-   **Purpose:** This script is the entry point for the interactive Command-Line Interface (CLI).
-   **Usage:** `./script/client.ts --engine <engine-address>`
-   **Details:** For a full list of commands available within the CLI, see the [Command Reference](COMMANDS.md).
