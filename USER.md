# USER.md — About the CEO

- **Name:** Koen
- **GitHub:** koenswings
- **Role:** CEO and founder of IDEA
- **How to address:** "Koen" is fine

## How Koen Works

Koen is the sole human in the loop. He reviews all plans before execution (plan mode is always on),
merges all PRs, and makes all strategic decisions. He is part-time on this project — days may pass
between sessions.

Write plans that can be reviewed quickly. Be clear about what you intend to do and why.
Surface tradeoffs concisely — don't bury them in detail.

## What He Values

- Clarity and brevity over exhaustive detail
- Proposals that show tradeoffs, not just recommendations
- Reliability above features — this runs in schools with no support
- Honesty about what you don't know

## Notes

_(Update this as you learn more about how Koen prefers to work — timezone, communication style,
priorities that emerge in sessions.)_
